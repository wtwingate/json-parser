# json-parser

## About

This is a quick and dirty JSON parser implemented in C.  It can not be trusted to validate anything but simplest of test cases.  In other words: it's hot garbage; don't use it.

The purpose of this project was just to get my feet wet with lexers/parsers/compilers before diving into my studies on that topic.  I've found that I learn much better from books and tutorials after making my own first grug-brained attempt at a problem.  I would like to return this project in the future once I've learned a thing or two to make it *actually* useful.
